    text: `If you want a fully automated process without human intervention, you can try the following approach to improve the accuracy of your captions:

    Use high-quality TTS software: To get better voiceover quality, consider using advanced TTS services with neural voices, such as Google Cloud Text-to-Speech with WaveNet voices, Amazon Polly with Neural voices, or Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services with Neural voices. These services provide more natural-sounding speech which can improve ASR accuracy.

    Adjust TTS settings: Many TTS services allow you to control the speed, pitch, and pronunciation of the generated speech. Adjust these settings to create clearer and more intelligible speech that can improve ASR performance.

    Optimize ASR settings: Use domain-specific models or custom speech models (if available) to improve ASR accuracy. Some ASR services, like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text or Microsoft Azure Speech to Text, allow you to use or create custom models tailored to your specific content.

    Use ASR adaptation: Some ASR services support adaptation features, like providing a list of custom phrases or boosting specific words in the recognition process. Use these features to improve the accuracy of the generated captions.

    Post-processing: After generating captions using ASR, use a script or a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool to correct common errors and improve the overall quality of the captions. This could include spell-checking, grammar correction, or sentence segmentation.

    Leverage timestamps from TTS: Since you're using TTS to generate the voiceover, you might be able to extract word-level timestamps directly from the TTS API. For example, Google Cloud Text-to-Speech provides word-level timestamps in the API response. You can use this information to create captions without the need for ASR, ensuring perfect accuracy.

This approach should help you create a more accurate and fully automated captioning system. However, keep in mind that without human intervention, it may still be challenging to achieve 100% accuracy.`,
